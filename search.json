    "text": "Data Access\n\n\n\n\nLaptops and Desktops\n\n\nWorking with a dataset of this scale on a personal computer can be challenging. For this reason, you will likely find it most effective to analyze specific regions or time periods you are interested in. However, downloading and analyzing the entire global dataset might be feasible if you select a coarser temporal resolution, such as the annual or long-term average data. Please see the Data Catalogue to decide if you have enough disk space for the data you are interested in.\nTo make this process as smooth as possible, we have formatted the data using Zarr, a modern format designed for cloud-native access. This allows you to stream only the data you need, saving significant time and disk space. Below, we provide functions to help you connect to our YODA data archive, select the data you wish to analyze, and save it to your disk. For quickly accessing information on the the latitude and longitude limits of your region of interest we suggest to make use of readily available tools such as geojson. In addition, it is possible to download the data directly from the YODA portal however user should be aware of the storage requirements.\n\n\n\nStreaming Data into memory\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDirect Download\n\n\nIf you think you have enough computational resources at hand, you can download the data at the global scale. For this, we provide you with options to download the data using YODA‚Äôs web-based access or from the download links in the Data Catalogue.\n\n\nHigh Performance Computing\n\n\nThis guide provides instructions for accessing the GLOBGM dataset on High-Performance Computing (HPC) systems. The recommended method depends on your specific system and preferences.\n\n\n\nDownload Data\n\n\nThe primary method for downloading the complete dataset is directly from the YODA (Your Data) repository. Several command-line tools can be used for this purpose, such as wget.\nwget -r -P PATH_ON_LOCAL_FILE_SYSTEM URL_TO_FOLDER_ON_YODA \n\n\nSnellius Users\n\n\nWe are actively working to make the GLOBGM dataset available as a managed dataset on the Snellius supercomputer. This will enable direct and optimized access for all Snellius users. Please watch this space for future updates on availability.\nIn the interim, users on Snellius can request direct access to the data. Please contact us to arrange a data transfer via the scratch file system.",

It employs a parallelized implementation of MODFLOW 6 with two model layers representing confined and unconfined aquifers. Designed for high-performance computing environments, GLOBGM efficiently simulates groundwater heads and water table depths worldwide, enabling detailed assessments of groundwater dynamics under historical and future climate and socioeconomic scenarios. The model uses refined input data and parameterization to capture global groundwater behavior while addressing computational challenges related to runtime, memory, and data storage at this fine resolution. We present comprehensive groundwater heads and water table depth data following the ISIMIP framework protocols.\n\n\n\nData Overview\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    \n      üï∞Ô∏è\n    \n    \n      Historical Reference\n      \n        Historical simulations span 1960‚Äì2019, forced by GSWP3-W5E5 meteorological data, enabling rigorous validation and impact attribution against observed climate records.\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n  \n    \n      üìà\n    \n    \n      Climate Projections\n      \n        Projections cover 1960‚Äì2100, driven by SSP-RCP scenarios (SSP1-2.6: low; SSP3-7.0: medium-high; SSP5-8.5: high) and GCMs (GFDL-ESM4, IPSL-CM6A-LR, MPI-ESM1-2-HR, MRI-ESM2-0, UKESM1-0-LL) to quantify groundwater dynamics under changing climate-forcings.\n      \n    \n  \n\n\n\nData Access\n\n\n\nGiven the large volume of data in this package, we recognize that all users may not have the computing resources necessary to process the data at a global scale.

Dark overlays indicate the presence of a confining layer and grids visualises the data structure regarding the two model layers.\n\n\nGLOBGM is a two-layer groundwater model, with outputs available for both layers. Properly interpreting these layers is essential for selecting the appropriate data in your analysis.\nThe aquifer type at any location is determined by the data presence in each layer:\n\nConfined System: Occurs where Layer 1 contains valid data, representing the confining layer (aquitard), with Layer 2 data corresponding to the underlying confined aquifer.\nUnconfined System: Identified where Layer 1 is null (no data) and Layer 2 has valid data, indicating an unconfined aquifer in Layer 2.\n\n\nTables below provide a general overview of the data package.
