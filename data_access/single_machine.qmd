  <h3>Single Machine Access</h3>
</div>

Working with a dataset of this scale on a personal computer can be challenging. For this reason, you will likely find it most effective to analyze specific regions or time periods you are interested in. However, downloading and analyzing the entire global dataset might be feasible if you select a coarser temporal resolution, such as the annual or long-term average data. Please see the Data Catalogue to decide if you have enough disk space for the data you are interested in.

To make this process as smooth as possible, we have formatted the data using Zarr, a modern format designed for cloud-native access. This allows you to stream only the data you need, saving significant time and disk space. Below, we provide functions to help you connect to our YODA data archive, select the data you wish to analyze, and save it to your disk. For quickly accessing information on the the latitude and longitude limits of your region of interest we suggest to make use of readily available tools such as [geojson](https://geojson.io/).

  <h3>Streaming Remote Data</h3>
</div>

```python
import xarray as xr
import zarr

def open_remote_globgm(file_url: str) -> xr.Dataset:
    """Opens a remote GLOBGM Zarr dataset from a file URL."""
    store = zarr.ZipStore(file_url, mode='r')
    return xr.open_zarr(store, consolidated=False)

# Configuration
FILE_URL = 'insert_your_file_url_here'
SAVE_PATH = 'globgm_subset.nc'
bounds = {
    'lat': slice(13.07, -35.24),
    'lon': slice(-21.12, 33.68),
    'time': slice('1960-01-01', '1961-01-01')
}

open_remote_globgm(FILE_URL).sel(**bounds).compute().to_netcdf(SAVE_PATH, mode='w')
```

  <h3>Downloading Data</h3>
</div>

If you think you have enough computational resources at hand then please do download the data at the global scale. For this, we provide you with a option to download the data using YODA's web based acces. Or alterntaively we provide you with some command line scripts which you can use to download the data.

### Web-Based Download

Utilize YODA's web-based portal for a straightforward, browser-based download experience. This method is ideal for manually selecting and downloading files.

### Command-Line Download

For automated, reproducible, or bulk downloading, we provide a set of command-line scripts that can be integrated directly into your workflows, enabling efficient data retrieval at scale.

```bash
source_url="https://geo.public.data.uu.nl/vault-globgm/research-globgm%5B1669042611%5D/original/output/version_1.0/steady-state/"

target_directory="save_directory"


mkdir -p $target_directory
wget -r -P /$target_directory $source_url 
#Add unzip stuff here
```
