## A Guide to Model Layers

GLOBGM is a two-layer groundwater model, and all outputs are provided for both layers. Layer 1 (L1) represents the shallow, unconfined aquifer system, which may include a confining unit, while Layer 2 (L2) represents the deeper, confined aquifer. Understanding how to interpret these layers is key to selecting the correct data for your analysis.

The relationship between the two layers determines the type of aquifer system at any given location:

Confined System: A confined system exists where Layer 1 has valid data. In this case, Layer 1 represents the confining layer (the aquitard), and the corresponding data in Layer 2 represents the underlying confined aquifer.

Unconfined System: An unconfined system is present where Layer 1 is null (has no data) and Layer 2 has data. In this scenario, the Layer 2 values represent the unconfined aquifer.

Below are common use-case scenarios to help you decide which data to use based on your research question.

## Common Use Cases and Data Selection

1. I want to distinguish between confined and unconfined areas.
To map out the locations of different aquifer systems, you should analyze Layer 1.

Where Layer 1 contains data, the system is confined.

Where Layer 1 is null, the system is unconfined.

2. I am interested in the shallowest groundwater.
If your research is focused on the first groundwater you would encounter from the surface (e.g., for shallow well analysis or surface-groundwater interactions), you should use a combination of both layers.

In confined areas (where Layer 1 has data), the shallowest groundwater is in Layer 1 (the confining layer).

In unconfined areas (where Layer 1 is null), the shallowest groundwater is in Layer 2.

3. I want to study only the deep groundwater systems.
To isolate and analyze only the deeper, typically confined groundwater resources, you should focus exclusively on Layer 2.

This layer represents the confined aquifer where a confining layer exists and the main unconfined aquifer where one does not. It consistently provides data on the primary, deeper groundwater body in the model.
